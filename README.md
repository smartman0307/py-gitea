# py-gitea
A very simple API client for Gitea

This is just a quick translation of swagger doc to python using simple hack and has not been throughly tested.

Its easy enough to understand for making changes and making it usable for purpose. 

# tests:
Can be run like this:

```python3 -m pytest tests.py```

Make sure to have a gitea-instance running on `http://localhost:3000`, and an admin-user token at `.token`.
